# 🏟️ CrowdFlow AI - Smart Event Management System

**Winner's Blueprint Implementation - Complete Hackathon Solution**

CrowdFlow AI is a sophisticated Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) system that predicts, simulates, and optimizes crowd flow using AI-powered insights. Built for the Malaysia hackathon challenge, this system helps event organizers make data-driven decisions to ensure safety and efficiency.

## 🎯 The Magic: Two-Part Architecture

### 1. High-Speed Simulation Engine (NumPy-based)
- **Fast & Self-Contained**: Pure NumPy implementation for maximum performance
- **Realistic Behavior**: Goal-oriented movement with collision detection
- **Multiple Scenarios**: Entry rush, mid-event congestion, emergency evacuation
- **Visual Output**: Real-time crowd density visualization

### 2. Smart AI Analysis Layer (AWS Bedrock)
- **Expert Analysis**: Interprets simulation results with domain expertise
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Provides specific, implementable solutions
- **Cost-Aware**: Balances safety improvements with budget considerations
- **Dynamic Prompting**: Uses simulation metrics to generate contextual advice

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Test the System
```bash
python run_crowdflow.py
```

### Launch Full UI
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🎮 How It Works: The Before/After Magic

### 1. User Configuration
- Adjust **Number of Attendees** with interactive slider
- Choose **Optimization Goal** (Safety, Cost, Evacuation)
- Set initial **Gate Configuration** (the "bad" setup)

### 2. "Before" Simulation
- Runs with user's attendee count + limited gates
- Shows real-time crowd movement animation
- Calculates congestion and wait time metrics

### 3. AI Analysis
- Sends final metrics to AWS Bedrock with dynamic prompt:
```
You are an expert event safety analyst. A crowd simulation produced:
- Number of Attendees: {user_input}
- Number of Open Gates: {limited_gates}
- Peak Congestion: {calculated}%
- Average Wait Time: {calculated} minutes

Provide actionable recommendations and optimized parameters.
```

### 4. "After" Simulation
- Automatically runs with **same attendee count**
- Applies **AI-recommended gate configuration**
- Shows side-by-side comparison with improvement metrics

### 5. Visual Comparison
- Live animations during both simulations
- Before/after heatmap comparison
- Metrics dashboard showing improvements
- AI recommendation explanation

# Expected: 40% reduction in wait times
```

### Mid-Event Congestion
```python
# Attendees move between stage, food, toilets
# AI optimizes flow patterns and staffing
```

### Emergency Evacuation
```python
# All attendees redirect to nearest exits
# AI optimizes exit capacity and routing
```

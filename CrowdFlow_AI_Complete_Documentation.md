## 🧮 **Detailed Estimation Formulas & Metrics Calculation**

### **1. Peak Congestion Percentage Formula**

**Method: Average Density Across Occupied Cells**

```python
# Step 1: Get visualization grid with attendee positions
vis_grid = self.get_visualization_grid()

# Step 2: Extract cells that contain attendees (values 5-9)
attendee_cells = vis_grid[vis_grid >= 5]  # Cells with attendees (5+ in vis_grid)

if len(attendee_cells) > 0:
    # Step 3: Convert visualization values to actual attendee counts
    # vis_grid values: 5=1 person, 6=2 people, 7=3 people, 8=4 people, 9=5+ people
    actual_densities = attendee_cells - 4  # Convert to actual attendee count
    
    # Step 4: Calculate average attendees per occupied cell
    avg_density = np.mean(actual_densities)  # Average attendees per occupied cell
    
    # Step 5: Convert to percentage (3 people per cell = 100% congestion)
    congestion_percent = min(avg_density / 3.0, 1.0) * 100  # Cap at 100%
else:
    congestion_percent = 0
```

**Why This Formula Works:**
- **Realistic Scaling**: Shows how crowded occupied areas actually are
- **Not Extreme**: More reasonable than venue utilization calculations
- **Responsive**: Increases as more people pack into same areas
- **Comparative**: Good for Before/After AI analysis
- **Threshold Logic**: 3 people per cell represents maximum safe density

### **2. Real Wait Time Calculation**

**Method: Moving Window of Recent Successful Entries**

```python
# Step 1: Find attendees who recently reached their goals
recent_entries = [a for a in self.attendees if a.goal_reached_step and 
                 a.goal_reached_step > self.current_step - 100]  # Last 100 steps

if recent_entries:
    # Step 2: Calculate average wait time in simulation steps
    avg_wait_steps = np.mean([a.goal_reached_step - a.entry_time_step 
                             for a in recent_entries])
    
    # Step 3: Convert simulation steps to real minutes
    wait_time_mins = int(avg_wait_steps / self.config["simulation_time_scale_factor"])
else:
    wait_time_mins = 5  # Default estimate when no recent data
```

**Key Components:**
- **goal_reached_step**: Simulation step when attendee reached destination
- **entry_time_step**: Simulation step when attendee entered venue
- **simulation_time_scale_factor**: Usually 10 (10 steps = 1 real minute)
- **Moving Window**: Uses last 100 steps for current conditions

**Why This Is Accurate:**
- **Real Data**: Based on actual attendee experiences, not estimates
- **Recent Window**: Reflects current congestion conditions
- **Time Scale Conversion**: Properly converts simulation time to real-world minutes

### **3. Entry Success Rate Formula**

**Method: Percentage of Attendees Successfully Inside Venue**

```python
# Step 1: Count attendees who successfully entered and are active in venue
attendees_in_venue = [a for a in self.attendees if 
                     self.map_data[a.x, a.y] == 0 and  # In open space (not stuck)
                     a.status in ["reached_goal", "mingling"]]  # Active statuses

# Step 2: Calculate percentage of total planned attendees
entry_success_rate = (len(attendees_in_venue) / len(self.attendees)) * 100 if self.attendees else 0
```

**Critical Conditions:**
- **self.map_data[a.x, a.y] == 0**: Must be in walkable open space
- **Status Filter**: Only count "reached_goal" and "mingling" attendees
- **Excludes**: Attendees stuck at gates, exited early, or in invalid positions

**Why This Matters:**
- **Capacity Analysis**: Shows what % of planned attendees actually get in
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Low rates indicate entry problems
- **AI Optimization Target**: Clear metric for improvement measurement

### **4. Visualization Grid Density Mapping**

**Method: No-Overlay System with Density Levels**

```python
# Step 1: Create base grid with fixed venue elements
vis_grid = self.map_data.copy().astype(float)

# Step 2: Calculate attendee density for each cell
attendee_density = np.zeros_like(vis_grid)
for attendee in self.attendees:
    if (0 <= attendee.x < vis_grid.shape[0] and 
        0 <= attendee.y < vis_grid.shape[1] and
        self.map_data[attendee.x, attendee.y] == 0):  # Only in open space
        attendee_density[attendee.x, attendee.y] += 1

# Step 3: Apply density encoding only to open spaces
for i in range(vis_grid.shape[0]):
    for j in range(vis_grid.shape[1]):
        if vis_grid[i, j] == 0 and attendee_density[i, j] > 0:
            # Encode density: 5=1 person, 6=2 people, ..., 9=5+ people
            vis_grid[i, j] = 5 + min(attendee_density[i, j] - 1, 4)  # 5-9 range
```

**Color Mapping System:**
- **0 (⚪ White)**: Open walkable space - empty
- **1 (⚫ Black)**: Wall obstacles - permanent barriers
- **2 (🔵 Blue)**: Destinations (food stalls, attractions) - always visible
- **3 (🟢 Green)**: Entry gates - spawn points, always visible
- **4 (🟠 Orange)**: Exit gates - evacuation points, always visible
- **5 (🔴 Light Red)**: 1 person in cell
- **6 (🔴 Red)**: 2 people in cell
- **7 (🔴 Dark Red)**: 3 people in cell
- **8 (🔴 Darker Red)**: 4 people in cell
- **9 (🔴 Darkest Red)**: 5+ people in cell

### **5. Time Conversion System**

**Method: Real-World Event Times to Simulation Steps**

```python
class TimeConverter:
    def __init__(self, start_time_str: str, scale_factor: int):
        self.start_time = datetime.strptime(start_time_str, "%H:%M")
        self.scale_factor = scale_factor  # Usually 10 steps = 1 minute

    def to_step(self, time_str: str) -> int:
        """Converts real-world time string to simulation step number."""
        event_time = datetime.strptime(time_str, "%H:%M")
        delta_minutes = (event_time - self.start_time).total_seconds() / 60
        return int(delta_minutes * self.scale_factor)
    
    def to_real_time(self, step: int) -> str:
        """Converts simulation step back to real-world time string."""
        minutes_elapsed = step / self.scale_factor
        real_time = self.start_time + timedelta(minutes=minutes_elapsed)
        return real_time.strftime("%H:%M")
```

**Example Calculations:**
- **Event Start**: 19:00 (7:00 PM)
- **Entry Rush End**: 19:01 (1 minute later)
- **Simulation Steps**: 1 minute × 10 steps/minute = 10 steps
- **Mid-Event Duration**: 19:01-19:10 = 9 minutes = 90 steps
- **Total Event**: 11 minutes = 110 steps + buffer

## 🎯 **Advanced Movement Algorithm: "Sense, Think, Act"**

### **🔍 SENSE Phase - Environmental Awareness**

```python
def _calculate_local_density(self, x: int, y: int, occupied: set, radius: int = 2) -> float:
    count = total = 0
    # Scan 5x5 grid (radius=2) around attendee position
    for i in range(max(0, x-radius), min(self.map_data.shape[0], x+radius+1)):
        for j in range(max(0, y-radius), min(self.map_data.shape[1], y+radius+1)):
            if self.map_data[i, j] != 1:  # Not a wall
                total += 1
                if (i, j) in occupied: count += 1
    return count / total if total > 0 else 0
```

**Environmental Detection:**
- **Local Area Scan**: Examines 5x5 grid around position (radius=2)
- **Density Calculation**: Counts people vs. available spaces
- **Obstacle Detection**: Identifies walls, gates, and destinations
- **Goal Awareness**: Tracks current target destination

### **🧠 THINK Phase - Decision Making**

```python
def _move_attendees_smart(self):
    # Take snapshot of world state for consistent decisions
    initial_occupied = {(a.x, a.y) for a in self.attendees}
    
    for attendee in agents_to_move:
        # Calculate local crowding
        density = self._calculate_local_density(attendee.x, attendee.y, initial_occupied)
        
        # Density-based hesitation (realistic crowd psychology)
        if density > 0.6 and np.random.rand() < density:
            continue  # Skip movement this step (wait in crowd)
        
        # Proceed with pathfinding if not hesitating
        best_move = self._find_best_neighbor(attendee, next_occupied)
```

**Decision Process:**
1. **Density Assessment**: If local area >60% crowded → consider waiting
2. **Probabilistic Hesitation**: Higher density = higher chance to wait
3. **Pathfinding**: If moving, calculate best neighbor toward goal
4. **Collision Prediction**: Check if target cell will be occupied

### **⚡ ACT Phase - Movement Execution**

```python
def _find_best_neighbor(self, attendee: Attendee, occupied: set) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]:
    neighbors = []
    # Check all 8 adjacent cells
    for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:
            if dx == 0 and dy == 0: continue
            new_x, new_y = attendee.x + dx, attendee.y + dy
            if (0 <= new_x < self.map_data.shape[0] and 
                0 <= new_y < self.map_data.shape[1] and 
                self.map_data[new_x, new_y] != 1):  # Not a wall
                neighbors.append((new_x, new_y))
    
    # Filter out occupied positions
    unoccupied_neighbors = [pos for pos in neighbors if pos not in occupied]
    if not unoccupied_neighbors: return None
    
    # Choose neighbor closest to goal (greedy pathfinding)
    distances = [np.sqrt((nx - attendee.goal[0])**2 + (ny - attendee.goal[1])**2) 
                for nx, ny in unoccupied_neighbors]
    return unoccupied_neighbors[np.argmin(distances)]
```

**Movement Rules:**
- **8-Directional Movement**: Can move to any adjacent cell
- **Collision Avoidance**: No two attendees occupy same cell
- **Goal Completion**: Track when attendees reach destinations
- **Greedy Pathfinding**: Always move toward goal if possible

## 🎭 **Complete Event Lifecycle Phases**

### **Phase 1: Entry Rush**
```python
def _create_attendees(self):
    active_entrances = self.locations['entrances'][:self.open_gates]
    for i in range(self.total_attendees):
        entrance = active_entrances[i % len(active_entrances)]
        # Random goal in open area
        goal_location = self.locations['open_space'][np.random.randint(0, len(self.locations['open_space']))]
        attendee = Attendee(id=i, x=entrance.x, y=entrance.y, goal=(goal_location.x, goal_location.y))
```

**Behavior Analysis:**
- All attendees start at entry gates (distributed by open_gates setting)
- Each gets random goal in venue's open areas
- Creates realistic entry bottlenecks at limited gates
- Density-based hesitation prevents unrealistic stampeding

### **Phase 2: Mid-Event Mingling**
```python
def _update_goals_for_phase(self, phase: str):
    if phase == "mid_event":
        for attendee in self.attendees:
            if np.random.random() < 0.02:  # 2% chance to leave early
                nearest_exit = min(self.locations['exits'], 
                    key=lambda e: abs(e.x - attendee.x) + abs(e.y - attendee.y))
                attendee.goal = (nearest_exit.x, nearest_exit.y)
                attendee.status = "leaving_early"
            else:
                # ALL attendees target destinations (food stalls, etc.)
                destination = self.locations['destinations'][attendee.id % len(self.locations['destinations'])]
                attendee.goal = (destination.x, destination.y)
                attendee.status = "mingling"
```

**Behavior Analysis:**
- **100% Destination Targeting**: All attendees visit food stalls/attractions
- **Early Leavers**: 2% decide to leave before main event ends
- **Realistic Distribution**: Even spread across all destination areas
- **Natural Flow**: Creates organic crowd distribution patterns

### **Phase 3: Emergency Evacuation**
```python
def _update_goals_for_phase(self, phase: str):
    if phase == "evacuation":
        for attendee in self.attendees:
            attendee.status = "evacuating"
            nearest_exit = min(self.locations['exits'], 
                key=lambda e: abs(e.x - attendee.x) + abs(e.y - attendee.y))
            attendee.goal = (nearest_exit.x, nearest_exit.y)
```

**Behavior Analysis:**
- **Immediate Response**: All attendees switch to evacuation mode
- **Nearest Exit Logic**: Each person heads to closest exit gate
- **Disappear on Exit**: Attendees vanish when reaching exit gates
- **Emergency Simulation**: Tests venue evacuation capacity

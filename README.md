# AI Crowd Control & Event Safety — Smarter Event Manager

Malaysia hosts hundreds of events yearly — concerts, football matches, festivals, parades, and even political rallies. Crowd surges, bottlenecks, and miscommunication often lead to chaos, long waiting times, or even safety risks. Traditional crowd management relies on manual monitoring, walkie-talkies, or expensive CCTV systems, which are reactive rather than proactive.

Your challenge is to design an AI-powered Crowd Control System that helps organizers predict, simulate, and manage crowd movements without requiring additional sensors or hardware. The solution should work using existing datasets (event schedules, ticketing data, seating charts, entry/exit gates, public transport times) and simulate multiple scenarios (entry rush, food court congestion, emergency evacuation, parking overflow).

This tool should be designed to assist event organizers, stadium managers, and city councils in making real-time or pre-event decisions to keep attendees safe and comfortable

Challenge: Build an AI solution that:
Ingests Data: Uses available structured datasets such as ticketing records, entry gate capacity, event schedules, train/bus arrival times, or simulated crowd data.
Simulates Scenarios: Models different crowd movements (entry rush at 7 PM, half-time exits, emergency evacuation).
Identifies Risks: Predicts hotspots (bottlenecks, overcrowded zones, parking overflow, restroom queues).
Suggests Solutions: Provides clear recommendations such as “Open Gate C earlier,” “Delay performer entry by 15 minutes,” or “Redirect crowd to Exit D.”
Supports Multiple Use Cases: Demonstrates at least 3 different crowd scenarios (e.g., concert entry, stadium exit, festival congestion).
User-Friendly: Outputs should be in dashboards, simple alerts, or WhatsApp-style notifications for event staff.

Evaluation Criteria:
Accuracy – How well does the system simulate realistic crowd scenarios?
Scalability – Can it be applied to small events (1,000 people) and large events (50,000+)?
Clarity – Are recommendations clear and actionable for non-technical event staff?
Scenario Coverage – Minimum of 3 scenarios must be demonstrated.
Practicality – Uses existing datasets (no special hardware required).
Innovation – Smart scenario handling (e.g., linking public transport timing to exit strategy).

Real-World Impact:
Safer, smoother events with reduced risk of accidents.
Cost savings for organizers (no need for expensive new hardware).
Builds public trust in large-scale gatherings.
Scalable to government/public safety use (Merdeka celebrations, Thaipusam, Hari Raya bazaars).

FAQ (Contestants Clarification)
Do we need live CCTV or IoT sensors?
→ No. Focus on predictive modeling with existing/simulated datasets.
Can we use mock event data?
→ Yes. Teams can create sample datasets for stadiums, concerts, etc.
Do we need to show real-time updates?
→ Optional. A simulation dashboard is enough, but real-time extensions earn bonus points.
What kind of scenarios should we cover?
→ At least 3: entry rush, mid-event congestion, and evacuation.
Can we integrate public transport data?
→ Yes, if available. Otherwise, mock schedules are acceptable.
How do we demonstrate effectiveness?
→ By showing “before vs after” crowd flow improvements in your simulation.
Is mobile app development required?
→ Not required. A web dashboard or chatbot for staff is sufficient.
Can we use AI forecasting models?
→ Yes. Time-series forecasting, reinforcement learning, or simulation models are all valid.
Should we design for organizers or attendees?
→ Primarily organizers/event managers. Attendee-facing solutions are optional add-ons.
How will this be judged if no real crowd is available?
→ Based on simulation logic, creativity of scenarios, and clarity of recommendations.

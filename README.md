## üß† Advanced Movement Algorithm: "Sense, Think, Act"

### **üîç SENSE Phase - Environmental Awareness**
```python
# Takes snapshot of world state at start of each step
initial_occupied = {(a.x, a.y) for a in self.attendees}
# This frozen snapshot ensures all attendees make decisions based on same world state
```

**How Each Attendee "Sees" Their Environment:**
- **Local Area Scan**: Examines 5x5 grid around their position (radius=2)
- **Density Calculation**: Counts people vs. available spaces in scan area
- **Obstacle Detection**: Identifies walls, gates, and destinations
- **Goal Awareness**: Knows their current target destination

### **üß† THINK Phase - Decision Making**
```python
density = self._calculate_local_density(attendee.x, attendee.y, initial_occupied)
if density > 0.6 and np.random.rand() < density:
    # HIGH DENSITY - attendee hesitates (realistic crowd psychology)
    continue  # Skip movement this step
```

**Intelligent Decision Process:**
1. **Density Assessment**: If local area >60% crowded ‚Üí consider waiting
2. **Probabilistic Hesitation**: Higher density = higher chance to wait
3. **Pathfinding**: If moving, calculate best neighbor toward goal
4. **Collision Prediction**: Check if target cell will be occupied

### **‚ö° ACT Phase - Movement Execution**
```python
best_move = self._find_best_neighbor(attendee, next_occupied)
if best_move:
    attendee.x, attendee.y = best_move
    next_occupied.add(best_move)  # Claim position to prevent collisions
```

**Movement Rules:**
- **Greedy Pathfinding**: Always move toward goal if possible
- **8-Directional Movement**: Can move in any adjacent direction
- **Collision Avoidance**: No two attendees can occupy same cell
- **Goal Completion**: Track when attendees reach destinations

## üé® Venue Layout System

### **Map Legend (Verified from Code)**
- **0 (‚ö™ White)**: Open walkable space - only area where attendees appear
- **1 (‚ö´ Black)**: Wall obstacles - permanent barriers
- **2 (üîµ Blue)**: Destinations (food stalls, attractions) - always visible
- **3 (üü¢ Green)**: Entry gates - spawn points, always visible
- **4 (üü† Orange)**: Exit gates - evacuation points, always visible
- **5-9 (üî¥ Red)**: Attendees with density levels (5=1 person, 9=5+ people)

### **No Overlay System (Critical Feature)**
```python
# Attendees ONLY appear in open spaces - never cover fixed objects
if (self.map_data[attendee.x, attendee.y] == 0):  # Only in open space
    attendee_density[attendee.x, attendee.y] += 1
```

**Why This Matters:**
- **Gates Always Visible**: You can always see entry/exit points
- **Destinations Always Visible**: Food stalls never get hidden
- **Realistic Constraints**: Attendees can't walk through walls or objects
- **Clear Visualization**: No confusion about venue layout

## üé≠ Complete Event Lifecycle Phases

### **Phase 1: Entry Rush (19:00-19:01)**
```python
# Attendees spawn at entry gates, move to random open spaces
goal_location = self.locations['open_space'][np.random.randint(0, len(self.locations['open_space']))]
attendee.goal = (goal_location.x, goal_location.y)
```

**Behavior:**
- All attendees start at entry gates (based on open_gates setting)
- Each gets random goal in venue's open areas
- Creates realistic entry bottlenecks
- Density-based hesitation prevents stampeding

### **Phase 2: Mid-Event (19:01-19:10)**
```python
# ALL attendees target destinations + 2% early exit
if np.random.random() < 0.02:  # 2% chance to leave early
    attendee.status = "leaving_early"
    # Target nearest exit
else:
    # ALL attendees target destinations (food stalls, etc.)
    destination = self.locations['destinations'][attendee.id % len(self.locations['destinations'])]
    attendee.goal = (destination.x, destination.y)
    attendee.status = "mingling"
```

**Behavior:**
- **100% Destination Targeting**: All attendees visit food stalls/attractions
- **Early Leavers**: 2% decide to leave before main event ends
- **Realistic Mingling**: People move between different venue areas
- **Natural Flow**: Creates organic crowd distribution

### **Phase 3: Emergency Evacuation (19:11+)**
```python
# All attendees immediately redirect to nearest exit
nearest_exit = min(self.locations['exits'], key=lambda e: abs(e.x - attendee.x) + abs(e.y - attendee.y))
attendee.goal = (nearest_exit.x, nearest_exit.y)
attendee.status = "evacuating"
```

**Behavior:**
- **Immediate Response**: All attendees switch to evacuation mode
- **Nearest Exit Logic**: Each person heads to closest exit gate
- **Disappear on Exit**: Attendees vanish when reaching exit gates
- **Emergency Simulation**: Tests venue evacuation capacity

## üìä Advanced Metrics System

### **Real-Time Wait Time Calculation**
```python
# TWO methods of wait time tracking:
# 1. When attendees can't move (density/space)
if (density > 0.6 and np.random.rand() < density) or not best_move:
    attendee.total_wait_time_steps += 1  # Increment when stuck

# 2. Track successful entries
if self.map_data[attendee.x, attendee.y] == 3 and self.map_data[best_move[0], best_move[1]] == 0:
    self.successful_entries += 1
    current_rate = (self.successful_entries / self.total_attendees) * 100
```

### **Updated Entry Rate System**
```python
# Progressive entry rate tracking
self.successful_entries = 0  # Count when moving from entrance‚Üíopen space
self.entry_progress = []     # Track rate progress over time

# Calculate growing success rate
current_rate = (self.successful_entries / self.total_attendees) * 100
self.entry_progress.append(current_rate)  # Store progress history
```

### **Method 1 Congestion Calculation**
```python
# Average density across occupied cells (chosen method)
attendee_cells = vis_grid[vis_grid >= 5]  # Cells with attendees
actual_densities = attendee_cells - 4  # Convert vis_grid values to attendee count
avg_density = np.mean(actual_densities)  # Average attendees per occupied cell
congestion_percent = min(avg_density / 3.0, 1.0) * 100  # 3 people per cell = 100%
```

**Method 1 Benefits:**
- **Realistic Scaling**: Shows how crowded occupied areas actually are
- **Not Extreme**: More reasonable than venue utilization (543%)
- **Responsive**: Increases as more people pack into same areas
- **Comparative**: Good for Before/After AI analysis

### **Entry Success Rate**
```python
# Percentage of attendees who successfully entered venue
attendees_in_venue = [a for a in self.attendees if 
                     self.map_data[a.x, a.y] == 0 and a.status in ["reached_goal", "mingling"]]
entry_success_rate = (len(attendees_in_venue) / len(self.attendees)) * 100
```

**Critical for Venue Planning:**
- **Capacity Analysis**: Shows what % of planned attendees actually get in
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Low rates indicate entry problems
- **AI Optimization Target**: Clear metric for improvement

## üèüÔ∏è Venue Capacity & Overcrowding Analysis

### **Realistic Capacity Constraints**
- **Concert Venue**: ~368 walkable spaces (calculated from venue_map.csv)
- **Configured Attendees**: 2000 people (intentional overcrowding)
- **Overcrowding Ratio**: 5.43 attendees per available space

### **Why Overcrowding Is a Feature, Not a Bug**
```python
# This creates realistic venue planning challenges
total_attendees = 2000  # Planned attendance
venue_capacity = 368    # Physical capacity
utilization = 543%      # Massive overcrowding for AI to solve
```

**Benefits for Venue Planning:**
- **Stress Testing**: Shows what happens when venues are overbooked
- **Bottleneck Analysis**: Identifies critical failure points
- **AI Value Demonstration**: Clear before/after improvement metrics
- **Real-World Relevance**: Many events face similar capacity challenges

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Optimization

### **Dynamic Analysis System**
```python
# AI analyzes complete simulation results
ai_analysis = {
    'critical_phase': 'entry_rush',  # Identifies problem areas
    'overall_assessment': 'Congestion detected during entry phase',
    'recommendations': [{'recommendation': 'Increase gate count', 'reason': 'Reduce bottlenecks'}],
    'optimized_parameters': {'recommended_open_gates': min(initial_gates + 2, 4)}
}
```

**AI Optimization Process:**
1. **Phase Analysis**: Identifies which event phase has problems
2. **Bottleneck Detection**: Finds specific congestion points
3. **Solution Generation**: Provides actionable recommendations
4. **Parameter Optimization**: Suggests specific gate configurations

### **Before/After Comparison**
